# XY Oracle Network Smart Contract API

Library toolkit for developing dApps connected to the XY Oracle Network. Users can subscribe to webhooks for event listeners from the XY contract using https://if-eth.com

## Roadmap

- Add todo methods, explain the security aspect of the oracle network
- Diviner signatures
- Elaborate more on example with if-eth webhooks
- Create comprehensive TODO on how the contract will need to accept XYO tokens
